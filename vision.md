# LogMyDose Vision

## The Problem

Millions of people are self-administering peptide therapies, HRT, and other advanced health protocols—often guided by Reddit threads, Discord servers, and fragmented forum advice. They're tracking doses in spreadsheets, setting phone reminders, and interpreting their own bloodwork without context.

The information exists, but it's scattered, inconsistent, and impersonal. People are making decisions about their health based on anecdotes from strangers rather than insights derived from their own data.

Meanwhile, clinics prescribing these therapies have no visibility into patient adherence between visits. They can't see if protocols are being followed, catch concerning patterns early, or optimize dosing based on real-world outcomes.

**The gap**: There's no intelligent system that learns from your data and proactively tells you what you need to know—before you think to ask.

## The Vision

**LogMyDose is ambient intelligence for health protocols.**

We're building the first platform where AI works continuously in the background—observing, analyzing, and surfacing insights without requiring prompts, questions, or chat interfaces.

No more wondering if your side effects are normal. No more guessing when to titrate. No more forgetting doses or losing track of reconstitution dates. No more interpreting bloodwork alone.

LogMyDose tells you what matters, when it matters.

## How We're Different

### Not a Chatbot
Most health apps bolt on a chat interface and call it "AI-powered." Users must know what to ask. LogMyDose inverts this—the AI watches your patterns and speaks first.

### Not Just Tracking
Tracking apps record data. LogMyDose transforms data into decisions. Every dose logged, every side effect reported, every lab result uploaded feeds an intelligence layer that connects the dots humans miss.

### Not Clinic-Dependent
Users can start immediately with protocol templates—no clinic required. But when they want professional oversight, linking to a clinic is seamless. The platform grows with the user.

## The Experience

**For Users:**
- Open the app. See what's relevant today.
- A card tells you your nausea correlates with morning doses—evening users report fewer issues.
- Another notes your BPC-157 was reconstituted 27 days ago—potency drops after 28.
- Your weekly report arrives: adherence is strong, injection site rotation needs attention.
- Tap any data point. Understand why it matters.

**For Clinics:**
- See which patients are thriving and which need attention.
- Catch adherence issues before the next appointment.
- Access outcome data that improves future protocols.
- White-label the experience as your own.

## The Market Opportunity

**Starting vertical**: Peptide therapy—a rapidly growing market with highly engaged users who are already self-educating and tracking manually.

**Expansion path**:
- Hormone Replacement Therapy (TRT, estrogen, thyroid)
- Supplements & Nootropics
- Prescription medications
- Fertility treatments

The substance-agnostic data model means adding new verticals is configuration, not reconstruction.

## The Business

**D2C + B2B Hybrid**

1. **Consumer subscriptions** ($9.99/month) build user base and prove value
2. **Clinic partnerships** ($99-299/month + per-patient fees) drive revenue scale
3. **Outcome data** becomes a defensible moat—proprietary insights on what protocols work

**Exit thesis**: Telehealth platforms are acquiring patient engagement tools. LogMyDose's combination of engaged users, clinic relationships, and outcome data makes it a strategic acquisition target at 6-9x revenue.

## Core Principles

**1. AI that works for you, not AI you work with**
Users should never need to prompt, ask, or search. Value is delivered continuously.

**2. Start simple, grow with the user**
Pick a template and start tracking in minutes. Add complexity—clinic links, detailed analytics, advanced protocols—only when ready.

**3. Data creates insight, insight creates action**
Every feature must close the loop: collect data → generate insight → enable action.

**4. Privacy by design, compliance by default**
Build HIPAA-ready architecture from day one. Users control their data. Clinics get access only with consent.

**5. Substance-agnostic, user-specific**
The platform handles any protocol. The intelligence is personalized to each user's data, goals, and patterns.

## Success Looks Like

**Year 1:**
- 10,000+ active D2C users
- 25+ clinic partnerships
- 80%+ weekly active rate among subscribers
- Protocol adherence data that demonstrates value

**Year 2-3:**
- Expansion into HRT and supplement verticals
- Android app launch
- $50k+ MRR
- Acquisition conversations with telehealth platforms

**The ultimate measure**: Users say "I don't know how I managed my protocol before this."

## Why Now

1. **Peptide therapy is mainstream**—GLP-1s like Semaglutide have brought peptides into public consciousness
2. **AI infrastructure is mature**—LLMs can now generate genuinely useful health insights at scale
3. **Telehealth is consolidating**—platforms are acquiring tools that drive patient engagement
4. **Users expect intelligence**—the bar for "good enough" has risen; passive tracking is table stakes

The window is open for a product that combines the engagement of consumer health apps with the intelligence users actually need.
